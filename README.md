## Disclaimer

I am not the original author of this web application. The original software can be found here:

https://github.com/mlbryant25701/D-DScreen

However, I have decided to create it under a new GitHub repo because I have modified most of the javascript code to fix errors, make it more efficient, and make it more readable. 

mlbryant25701 is the original mastermind behind this; if you want to thank anyone, thank him.

## RPG Initiative Tracker
##### (with weather, time, and date tracking also)
### 'Installation'
1. Extract contents to a folder.
2. Open GameScreen.HTML.

### Usage

#### Adding Players

1. Type in a player's character name (or their actual name)
2. Click checkbox below their name
3. Click the "Add to Initiative" button

#### For Monsters
1. (Optional) Type in a monster's name.
2. Click "Add Monster" button.
3. Multiple monsters can be added by continuing to click the "Add Monster" button. The site will append their names with numbers.

#### For NPCs
1. As monsters, but click the "Add NPC" button instead.


### Time
* Time can be paused, unpaused, added to, subtracted from, etc using the up and down arrows next to their specific area.

### Weather
* Weather will update randomly every:
  * Hour
  * Day
  * Week
  * Month
* Refreshing the page also generates a random weather.


## Theoretical roadmap, in no particular order:

* Reorganize and change the HTML so I can feel less bad about using someone else's code
* Ability to change character portraits and have them save
* Save names
* Rudimentary character sheets (for DM tracking purposes)
* Dice rolling feature
* Add ability to change background
* Possibly add a music player? Or soundboard player?
* Add/remove dates/time from date/clock
